# tic_tac_toe_rusty

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with a basic GUI.

This was inspired by the command line Tic-Tac-Toe game with a simple AI that introduced in the free tutorial hosted [here](https://brandonio21.com/building-tic-tac-toe-in-rust-rustic_tac_toe/) by [Brandon Milton](https://github.com/brandonio21).
All credit for the idea goes to the *original author*.

This implementation was created by first following along the free tutorial and then implementing several additions and re-implementing several different parsts. 
Among others, the original implementation was severly rewritten, most noteable changes include:

 * simplified at several steps
 * made more rusty
 * diagonal checking was added to the AI logic implementation
 * implementation was changed from the follow-along tutorial to a more sophisticated setup,
 * several changes to the implementation
 * test added
 * added different difficulties

## Installation

Simply run `cargo build --release` followed by `cargo run
## State of the Code
This small project was done to improve my skills in Rust. The code was written in Dec, 2021, and reflects my skills at that time.
